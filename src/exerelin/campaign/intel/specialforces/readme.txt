What are special forces?

Each special forces task group is a single route + fleet that flies around doing whatever it deems best at the time. This currently includes:
- Defending against incoming raids (RaidIntel-type events) threatening the faction
- Assisting its faction's raids against enemy markets/systems
- Patrolling valuable, vulnerable faction markets
- Defending a system when player is hostile and present in force

Each task group has a persistent commander and flagship, generated at the start of the event. 
If the fleet takes enough losses (about 40%), it goes back to a friendly market to "reconstitute". 
Reconstituting a fleet replaces all its ships (except the flagship, if that's still alive) and all officers except the commander.

The event ends if the fleet takes at least 90% losses.
